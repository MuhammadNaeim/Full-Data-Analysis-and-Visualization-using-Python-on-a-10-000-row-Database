# **Full Data Analysis and Visualization using Python on a 10,000-row Top Moveis Database**

- **Here, I have done a full data analysis and visualization on the top movies database using python libraries like: pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib.**
### The goal of the analysis is to answer 3 questions and draw conclusions through the analysis process using visualization tools in python.

## **Questions:**

1. What are the most popular genres from year to year?
2. What are the properties of the highest revenue films?
3. What is the inflation rate throughout the time?

### **Throughout this analysis process I have answered these 3 questions through 3 phases:**

1. **Data Wrangling phase:**
    - throughout this phase, I investigated the dataset looking for duplicated rows and null values to handle them in a nice way where I don't spoil the data.
    - fixing columns data type to get accurate results.
    - removing unuseful columns from the dataset to keep the process nice and clean.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis phase:**
    - throughout this phase, I answered the 3 questions I stated above, by doing some statistic calculations.
    - supporting those calculations with visuals to make it easy to understand.
    - drawing conclusions about each result.
3. **Conclusions phase:**
    - throughout this phase, I explained my findings and insights I got from data to non-technical clients.
    - the limitation I faced throughout the process.
